# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
We are assisting Louise in comparing her short fundraising campaign for her play Fever to other campaigns in relation to their goals and launch dates. Will a specific month that the play is released determine its success? Will having a large fundraising goal cause the project to fail?
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In this analysis, we are looking at the relationship between when a theater project is launched correlates with the success or failure of a project. In order to achieve this, we had to create a pivot chart that would allow me to filter the category specifically to Theater.

We then want to compare our outcomes (successful, failed, or cancelled) by a breakdown of the months not filtered to any specific year. If we wanted to look at a specific year, we needed to create a Years column on our main dataset so that we can filter via our pivot table. The Years column was generated by taking the Date Created Conversion column and applying the =YEARS( ) Function.

Once the pivot chart has all the required information, we then generate a line chart to visualize our analysis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In this analysis, we are determining if the amount of the funding goal effects the outcome of the Play. What we do first is create a table that groups each outcome by its funding goal. For this purpose, we will use the COUNTIFS Function.

Then we determine the percentage of each outcome by dividing the outcome by the total projects per monetary goal range. Once our table is complete, we then can generate our line graph for visual analysis.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
My challenge with this analysis was the syntax of the COUNTIFS function. I was confused on how and where to place the goal ranges within the parenthesis. I used the resources provided within the bootcamp page as well as google to help assist with this challenge and to gain better understanding of the function.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?<br/>
Theater is most successful when launched in May than any other month despite the year. Out of a total of 166 theater projects in the month of May, 111 were successful. 
Also, if a theater project is launched in December, it is almost a 50/50 chance that your project can fail.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?<br/>
The higher likelihood of a Play being successful was based on the fundraising goal being $4999 or less.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?<br/>
I would have liked to go a step further and added genres to the dataset. Maybe certain genres are more popular that would then cause them to yield a successful result. Certain genres can also require more funding compared to others as well.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?<br/>
A bar graph comparing a subcategory that can be filtered per parent category to demonstrate the average donations received over years. It can show that individuals are more likely to contribute and favor one category over another.
